**THIS FILE CONTAINS THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL**
Purpose: make requests from a to analyze some data (in this case send an input to the server).
-encrypted comunication (useing RSA for key exchange and AES to encrypt the data)
-synchronous
**TEXT BASED PROTOCOL**
**USES TCP**
**EVERY MESSAGE WILL HAVE A LENGTH FEILD IN THE BEGINING (NOT ENCRYPTED) THE LENGTH FEILD IS 12 BYTES LONG (IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT MULTIPLE (IN CASE THE SERVICE CHANGES) LARGE IMAGES CAN BE SENT)**

HANDSHAKE: (happens in the begining of the comunication)
server -> client: This is my public rsa key (in PEM)
client -> server: This is the communication key encrypted with your public rsa key - ready to start
server -> client: ready to start (This message is encrypted)
---both sides have the kay and can  encrypt and decrypt their messages - the conversation can start---
services (examples):
"Digit recognition"

**CLIENT SEND FIRST MESSAGE AFTER HANDSHAKE**

when the server sends images it will send 4 fields for each image: image id, the bytes, the digit and the confidence of the digit
